Hi, I’m Anthea 👋

Backend & Data Infrastructure Engineer
Berkeley EECS

I build scalable data pipelines, distributed systems, and performance-optimized backend infrastructure.

My work focuses on:

High-throughput ETL pipelines

REST API ingestion with retry & caching

Knowledge graph construction (Neo4j, KGX)

Concurrency & parallel computing

Cloud deployment (AWS EC2, Lambda)

CI/CD & containerized workflows

🚀 Featured Projects
🧠 Knowledge Graph Microbe (kg-microbe)

Config-driven ETL pipeline integrating 10+ heterogeneous data sources into a unified Neo4j knowledge graph.

Highlights:

Reduced dataset processing from ~2 years to 30 hours via parallelization & scheduling

Reduced API calls by 33% using SQLite-backed HTTP caching

Integrated REST APIs with retry logic and concurrency tuning

CI/CD with pytest, tox, Jenkins

Dockerized scheduled ingestion workflows
